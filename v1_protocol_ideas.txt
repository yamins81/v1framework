determine from system parameters:
	upper bound on max size
	which fft


image generation:

    basic op:
    	select background
	    select invariance parameters
	    select shape
	
    	get image
	
	
	image generation api:
		take query to model db defining subset of models
		take ranges and steps in invariance parameters
		take number of backgrounds
		
		generate and put into science_db
	

for given image set:

    image preprocessing 
	    which handles max size
	
    normin images

    compute ffts of processed/normed-in images
    
    

for filter-model choice and filter params:

    generate initial filters
    	
	in case of unsupervised:
		generate unsupervised training set UTrS
		do learning with UTrS
	
    fft of filters 


for filterbank / imageset pair (and downstream params):
	if filterbank was UTrS trained, make sure imageset and UTrS set have no intersection?
	convolve
	activate
	normout
	pool
	post-processing features


define task in terms of imageset division query
	generate splits / loo, making sure STrS and STeS are
